    ```

5.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:8788/](http://localhost:8788/) to use the application.

## Usage

This UI is configured to be used with the Abacus.ai API.

1.  **Get an Abacus.ai API Key:**
    - Sign up for an account at [abacus.ai](https://abacus.ai/).
    - Navigate to the API keys dashboard and generate a new API key.

2.  **Configure your API Key:**
    - Open the `wrangler.toml` file and replace the placeholder API key in the `[vars]` section with your own Abacus.ai API key.
    ```toml
    [vars]
    ABACUS_API_KEY = "your-api-key-goes-here"
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    - The application is pre-configured to use the Abacus.ai API.
    - The **Model** dropdown will be populated with a list of common models. You can customize this list in `src/api/tags.js`.
